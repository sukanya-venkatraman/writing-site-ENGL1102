Talk to Me – A Mini Chatbot:
Welcome to my little corner of the web where you can "talk" to me through a chatbot I coded!
This project was created as the Wildcard exhibit for my ENGL1102 ePortfolio — a space to reflect a more personal, creative, and technical side of my writing journey.

What It Is:
This is a simple HTML + JavaScript chatbot that mimics a casual conversation with me.
It includes a handful of dialogue options — from asking how I’m doing, to talking about the really long, obscure webnovels I like to read when I have time to spiral.

Think of it like a choose-your-own-text-path — except you're choosing how to interact with me.

Why It Exists:
This project blends two things I care about:
+ Creative expression
+ Coding as a form of writing

The prompts may be short, but each option is a little window into my brain: what I think about, how I talk, and how I process the world. It’s also an example of how digital tools can shape storytelling.

Built With:
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript (vanilla)
+ No libraries, no frameworks — just me, a text editor, and a lot of trial and error.
