No more pearls of wisdom — my fountain of inspiration is dry… But on a more serious note, something my dad once told me that’s really stuck is: 'What you cannot measure, you cannot manage.' When you’re trying to improve at anything, if you’re unable to self-assess and gauge your level, you’ll never be able to tell what’s working or where to grow. So — take stock.

        "Part of a story I was writing for my sister's graduation: There are two people standing, side by side together, looking ahead to the road in front of them. It feels as though they have just caught up to the other. The two of them had been walking this path together for days, months, years now. But now they were at a crossroads. One path leads forward - both are unable to see where it ends. The other path curves right, deeper into another forest. Up till now, they had traveled their journey together, unwilling to leave each other’s side for too long. It had always been a race for the two of them, but it was a race where they knew the other would be waiting at the finish line. This new path did not guarantee the finish line, it guaranteed nothing. But unlike all the paths before, all the crossroads and mountains, they knew it was time to part.",
        "Give a palindrome a backstory - "nut for a jar of tuna": Sitting upside down on a carriage attempting to read the fading board of a shop down the road while riding away on the back of a horse is admittedly a preposterous, and rather painful thing to do. Your head tips backward, the blood rushes to your face and you look like a squashed tomato at the end of a performance, all wrinkled and red, with your insides spilling out and a bit of green from the stem caught somewhere in the middle.",
        "A car salesman having a tough time - a little excerpt from a comedy I'm TRYING to write (my humor stores are empty): 'Listen–Listen. I have connections okay? My cousin’s best friend’s uncle once sold cars. He told me dealerships always have secret discounts. You take another $10,000 off, and we have a deal.' The customer, Telemus, said as though he was the one offering him the best deal. He was so tired. It was almost five in the evening and their dealings had already been going on for over an hour. An hour of a grown man spilling his entire tragic backstory of how his mother had left him as a child and how he formed a special connection to the car she had used to drive away from them, which so happened to have a sticker that greatly resembled their own car logo. After he had learned this, his admiration of the shapes and the curves of their 'beautifully muscular machinery' had developed. Apparently, it reminded him of his mother. Eugh. He just wanted to get through this deal and call it a day."
