No more pearls of wisdom — my fountain of inspiration is dry… But on a more serious note, something my dad once told me that’s really stuck is: 'What you cannot measure, you cannot manage.' When you’re trying to improve at anything, if you’re unable to self-assess and gauge your level, you’ll never be able to tell what’s working or where to grow. So — take stock. Be honest with yourself. That’s usually where the progress starts.";
